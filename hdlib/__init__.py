"""__hdlib__ is a Python 3 library for building Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA, a.k.a. Hyperdimensional Computing).

VSA is an emergent computing paradigm that works by combining vectors in a high-dimensional space for representing and 
processing information. This approach recently shown promise in various domains for dealing with different kind of 
computational problems, including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, robotics, natural language processing, 
bioinformatics, medical informatics, cheminformatics, and internet of things among other scientific disciplines.

The library is distributed under the MIT license as a Python package through PyPI and Conda on the _conda-forge_ channel.

Please refer to the official [Wiki](https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib/wiki) for any information about the implemented 
modules and how to use the library."""
